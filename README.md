# Gesture-Tracking-And-Music-Construction
A process for converting hand gestures and signals to different tones which can be modulated between through a system of established hand gestures
(The images provided in this were the seeds used for doing data augmentation, and the process of augmenting by position and color worked relatively well, but I don't have as much information about the efficiency of depth since the manual testing I have done with depth is not so much.)
